# Valence Prediction with Raw Audio File Analysis!

Hello and welcome!

The main goal of this project was to use raw audio data to predict valence in order to build build audio recommendation software. Valence is an index of musical energy and emotion evoked by the song. All data analysis was done using jupyter notebook using music downloaded with the spotify API. We used Librosa, a Python module for audio analysis and building spectrograms. Several types of models were tested, including KNN, XGBoost and Neural Networks. Annotated data proved itself hard to acquire and our findings revealed that annotations for streaming platforms are not good enough for a reliable model.
